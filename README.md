## Sustainable Futures

 - Problem: Although growing your own plants provides many benefits for a sustainable future, urban dwellers often have little exposure to gardening, so they may not know how to care for plants.
 - benefits of growing plants:
   - Improved air quality
   - Some plants (spider plants) minimize allergens
   - Supplemental food source
   - Reduction in food transportation costs
   - Reduced stress
   - Basic education about gardening

Solution:
Plant.io can help by monitoring moisture and light levels, reminding you when it's time to water and giving a visual and audible indication of the plantâ€™s overall wellness.

## Demo

### Adafruit.io dashboard

## Challenges

 - provided moisture sensor isn't suitable for measuring soil moisture, so we simulated this using a adafruit feed
 - tactile button doesn't attach well to the board

## Future Directions

 - Implement custom dashboard based on our prototype for better user experience 
 - Use a soil-specific moisture sensor to replace simulated sensor
 - Integrate a temperature monitor
 - include email or phone notifications
